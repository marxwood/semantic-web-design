# Reading Path — Designer

This path is for designers transitioning from **screen-based** thinking to **meaning-based** design.

You do not need to understand infrastructure.  
You _do_ need to understand consequences.

## Role mode

- → [UI Concept — Role Switcher](urn:swd:toc:v2:uiconcept:role-switcher)

## Start here

- → [Foundations 01 — Design After Screens](urn:swd:toc:v2:foundations:01)
- → [Foundations 02 — Meaning as the Unit](urn:swd:toc:v2:foundations:02)

## Build semantic intuition

- → [Semantics 01 — Entities as Interaction Primitives](urn:swd:toc:v2:semantics:01)
- → [Semantics 03 — States and Transitions](urn:swd:toc:v2:semantics:03)

## Learn graph navigation

- → [GraphNav 01 — Graph Thinking for UI/UX](urn:swd:toc:v2:graphnav:01)
- → [GraphNav 04 — Decision Points](urn:swd:toc:v2:graphnav:04)
- → [GraphNav 05 — Orientation Without Breadcrumbs](urn:swd:toc:v2:graphnav:05)

## Responsibility and trust

- → [Dual 03 — Intent Capture](urn:swd:toc:v2:dual:03)
- → [Dual 05 — Explainability UI](urn:swd:toc:v2:dual:05)

## Close
