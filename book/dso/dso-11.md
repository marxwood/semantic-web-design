# DSO 11 — Designing for Evolution

Products do not fail because they change.  
They fail because change was not designed.

Semantic Web Design assumes evolution as a constant.

## Why evolution must be explicit

In long-lived systems:

- meanings shift
- rules accumulate
- exceptions harden
- legacy becomes invisible

If change is implicit, the system decays.

## Designing with future change in mind

Designers must assume:

- entities will gain properties
- relationships will deepen
- constraints will tighten
- capabilities will split

This is not pessimism.  
It is realism.

## Evolution without rupture

Good semantic systems enable:

- additive change over breaking change
- coexistence of versions
- gradual migration
- explicit deprecation

Design systems must encode these strategies.

## The designer’s role

Designers must:

- name concepts precisely
- avoid overloading meaning
- plan exit paths
- document intent

Clarity today is flexibility tomorrow.
