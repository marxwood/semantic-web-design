# DSO 01 — From Component Libraries to Ontologies

Most design systems are catalogs of components.  
That made sense when UI was the product.

In semantic systems, this is insufficient.

A modern design system must function as an **ontology**: a shared, explicit model of meaning.

## Why component libraries plateau

Component libraries optimize:

- visual consistency
- reuse
- delivery speed

They do not address:

- meaning consistency
- behavioral guarantees
- cross-surface operation
- agentic interaction

As products scale, components drift in meaning while staying visually identical.

## What an ontology provides

An ontology defines:

- what entities exist
- how they relate
- which actions are allowed
- which constraints apply

In a design system, this means:

- components are typed
- states are named
- actions are declared
- constraints are shared

The system stops being a toolbox and becomes a language.

## The design system as shared contract

When the design system is ontological:

- designers, engineers, and agents share meaning
- changes can be reviewed semantically
- automation can rely on guarantees
- governance becomes possible

This does not remove creativity.  
It removes accidental inconsistency.

## The shift in mindset

Old:

> “Which component do we use?”

New:

> “Which concept are we expressing?”

Components become **projections of concepts**, not primitives.
