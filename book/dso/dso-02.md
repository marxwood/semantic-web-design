# DSO 02 — Typing Entities in Design Systems

Typing is how meaning becomes enforceable.

In Semantic Web Design, **types are not technical artifacts**.  
They are design decisions.

## Why typing matters

Without types:

- everything becomes “generic”
- rules cannot be enforced
- relationships blur
- agents cannot reason safely

Typing introduces structure without rigidity.

## What it means to type an entity

Typing an entity means declaring:

- what kind of thing it is
- which properties it has
- which actions apply
- which constraints govern it

For designers, this replaces vague labels with explicit concepts.

## Types vs components

A component answers:

> “How does this look?”

A type answers:

> “What kind of thing is this?”

Components can change.  
Types should be stable.

## Typing as a collaboration surface

When types are explicit:

- designers align on vocabulary
- engineers align on contracts
- agents align on expectations

The design system becomes the source of truth for meaning.
