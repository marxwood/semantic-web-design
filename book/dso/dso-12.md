# DSO 12 — Versioning Meaning

Versioning code is easy.  
Versioning meaning is hard.

Semantic Web Design treats meaning as a versioned artifact.

## Why meaning must be versioned

When meaning changes:

- old assumptions break
- automation misfires
- users lose trust
- agents behave unpredictably

Silent semantic change is the most dangerous kind.

## What it means to version meaning

Versioning meaning involves:

- explicit schema versions
- clear deprecation paths
- migration strategies
- coexistence rules

Design systems must surface this.

## Backward compatibility as a design constraint

Compatibility is not just technical.

Designers must consider:

- how old projections behave
- how mixed versions interact
- how to signal deprecated meaning
- when breaking change is acceptable

## Closing the DSO cluster

At this point, the design system is:

- semantic
- evolvable
- governable
- agent-ready

This is no longer a library.  
It is an operating system for interaction.
