# DSO 04 — State Machines Belong in Design Systems

State machines are usually treated as implementation details.  
This is a mistake.

They belong in the design system.

## Why designers must own state machines

If designers do not define states and transitions:

- engineers infer them
- agents guess them
- inconsistencies proliferate

State machines encode product truth.

## What it means to design a state machine

Designing a state machine means:

- naming states explicitly
- defining legal transitions
- marking irreversible edges
- assigning responsibility

This is design work, not engineering overhead.

## Design systems as behavioral contracts

When state machines live in the design system:

- UI becomes consistent by construction
- automation respects rules
- governance becomes reviewable
- change impact is visible

The system gains behavioral integrity.

## A practical guideline

If a transition requires a meeting to explain, it should be in the design system.
