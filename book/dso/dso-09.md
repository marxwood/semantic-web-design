# DSO 09 — Designing for Agent Surfaces

Agents do not see screens.  
They see **contracts**.

Designing for agent surfaces means exposing meaning in a form that is:

- explicit
- typed
- constrained
- auditable

Anything less is guesswork.

## What an agent surface is

An agent surface is a projection that:

- exposes entities and relations directly
- declares available capabilities
- encodes constraints and authority
- provides machine-readable feedback

APIs are necessary but not sufficient.  
Agent surfaces require semantics, not just endpoints.

## Why this is a design problem

If designers ignore agent surfaces:

- engineers improvise semantics
- agents operate on partial meaning
- automation becomes brittle
- responsibility is unclear

Agent surfaces must be **designed**, not inferred.

## Human vs agent projections

Human projections optimize for:

- comprehension
- cognitive load
- narrative flow

Agent projections optimize for:

- determinism
- completeness
- explicitness
- safety

Both project the same meaning, differently.
