# DSO 05 — Constraints as Design Tokens

Design tokens traditionally encode **appearance**.  
Semantic Web Design extends them to encode **rules**.

Constraints are design tokens for behavior.

## Why constraints belong in the design system

If constraints live only in code:

- designers cannot reason about behavior
- inconsistencies emerge across surfaces
- automation becomes unsafe
- reviews become cosmetic

Making constraints explicit is a design responsibility.

## What a constraint-token is

A constraint-token declares:

- allowed values
- forbidden states
- required preconditions
- invariants that must hold

Examples:

- “This action requires approval”
- “This state cannot be reverted”
- “This value must be unique”

These are not implementation details.  
They are interaction guarantees.

## How constraint-tokens are used

Constraint-tokens can:

- drive form validation
- gate actions
- inform confirmations
- guide agent behavior
- enable audits

One rule, many surfaces.

## The payoff

When constraints are tokens:

- UI becomes thinner
- logic becomes consistent
- behavior becomes inspectable
- meaning becomes stable
