# DSO 10 — Modeling Uncertainty in Design Systems

Not all meaning is certain.  
Pretending otherwise is dangerous.

Semantic Web Design treats uncertainty as a **first-class design input**.

## Why uncertainty must be explicit

Hidden uncertainty leads to:

- overconfidence
- irreversible mistakes
- unsafe automation
- erosion of trust

Designers must decide where precision ends.

## Ways to model uncertainty

Uncertainty can be expressed as:

- confidence levels
- probability ranges
- incomplete states
- pending verification

These are semantic properties, not UI hints.

## Designing with uncertainty

Good systems:

- block irreversible actions under uncertainty
- require human review when confidence is low
- expose confidence to operators and agents
- allow refinement over time

Uncertainty is not weakness.  
It is honesty.

## The boundary of projection

No projection should imply certainty that the underlying meaning does not have.

This is a hard rule.
