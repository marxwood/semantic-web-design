# Semantics

This cluster defines **what things are**, **how they relate**, and **what rules govern them**.

Semantics is the layer that:

- replaces ad-hoc UI logic
- enables agents to reason
- makes systems explainable

## What this cluster gives you

- entities as first-class citizens
- states vs variants
- actions as capabilities
- constraints, side effects, authority

Without semantics, graph navigation collapses into chaos.

## Entry paths

Choose based on interest:

- structure → Entities & Relations
- time → State, History, Irreversibility
- power → Authority, Permissions, Responsibility

## Continue

- → [Dual Surfaces — Entry](urn:swd:toc:v2:entry:dual)
- → [Operations — Entry](urn:swd:toc:v2:entry:ops)
