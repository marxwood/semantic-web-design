# Design System Ontology

This cluster bridges **semantic models** and **design systems**.

It explains how:
- components become projections
- tokens gain meaning
- systems evolve without breaking
- design systems stop being static libraries

## Why this matters

Traditional design systems assume:
- fixed screens
- human-only usage
- static hierarchies

DSO supports:
- agents
- graphs
- evolution
- semantic stability
