# Foundations

This cluster establishes the **mental shift** required for Semantic Web Design.

It reframes design from:
- interfaces → meaning
- screens → entities
- flows → consequences

If you read only one cluster, start here.

## What this cluster gives you

- a new design unit: meaning
- a non-hierarchical mental model
- a foundation for agent-compatible systems
- a shared language with engineers and AI systems

## How to navigate

You can:
- read sequentially
- jump to any concept
- branch into Semantics or GraphNav at any time

There is no "correct" order.
