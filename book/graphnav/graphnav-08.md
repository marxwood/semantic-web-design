# GraphNav 08 — Managing Cognitive Load in Graphs

Graphs surface complexity.  
Design manages it.

The goal is not to simplify the graph, but to **pace understanding**.

## Sources of cognitive load

In graph navigation, load comes from:

- too many visible edges
- unclear intent
- hidden consequences
- mixed levels of abstraction

Left unmanaged, users disengage.

## Design techniques that reduce load

Effective techniques include:

- edge clustering by goal
- staged disclosure
- consistent edge semantics
- contextual summaries
- "why this matters" cues

These techniques preserve power while improving clarity.

## Load management vs restriction

Reducing load does not mean removing capability.
It means **sequencing access**.

Well-designed graphs feel simple without being simplistic.

## For agents

Agents manage load through:

- heuristic pruning
- cost functions
- confidence thresholds
- time or depth limits

Human and agent strategies should align.
