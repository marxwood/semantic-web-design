# GraphNav 03 — Traversing State Graphs

When entities have state, navigation becomes **temporal**.

You are not only moving across concepts.  
You are moving **through time and permission boundaries**.

## What a state graph is

A state graph models:
- states as nodes
- legal transitions as edges
- irreversible boundaries
- conditional paths

Navigation across states is navigation across meaning.

## Why state traversal must be explicit

If state transitions are implicit:
- users are surprised
- agents misfire
- audits fail
- recovery is unclear

Explicit traversal:
- makes consequences visible
- enforces constraints consistently
- supports rollback where possible

## Designing traversal affordances

Designers should:
- label transitions clearly
- show current state context
- mark irreversible edges
- preview effects of traversal

Traversal is an action, not a link.

## Human vs agent traversal

Humans need:
- explanation
- confirmation
- context

Agents need:
- preconditions
- postconditions
- determinism

Both traverse the same graph.
