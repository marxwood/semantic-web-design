# GraphNav 01 — Graph Thinking for UI/UX

Navigation is not movement between screens.  
Navigation is **movement through meaning**.

Graph Navigation starts by replacing linear mental models with relational ones.

## Why trees fail

Hierarchies assume:
- a single correct path
- parent-child dominance
- predictable depth

Real products violate this:
- entities relate in multiple ways
- users arrive from anywhere
- goals change mid-navigation

Trees collapse under real use.

## Graphs reflect reality

Graphs allow:
- multiple entry points
- lateral discovery
- contextual shortcuts
- revisiting concepts without repetition

This mirrors how users think and how agents reason.

## What changes for designers

Designers stop asking:
> "Where does this page live?"

They ask:
> "What is this connected to?"

Navigation becomes a design of **edges**, not menus.

## Practical implication

Every page should answer:
- What entity is this about?
- What relationships are relevant here?
- What actions make sense now?
- Where can I go next that preserves meaning?

If those answers are unclear, navigation will be confusing.
