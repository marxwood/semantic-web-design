# GraphNav 05 — Orientation Without Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs assume a path.  
Graphs do not.

In graph navigation, orientation comes from **context**, not from retracing steps.

## Why breadcrumbs break in graphs

Breadcrumbs fail when:

- there are multiple valid paths
- users arrive from different entry points
- state affects availability
- traversal is non-linear

They imply a single "correct" hierarchy that does not exist.

## Contextual orientation

Graph orientation answers:

- What is this about?
- How is it connected?
- What state am I in?
- What can I do next?

This information should be visible **at every node**.

## Designing contextual anchors

Designers should surface:

- the primary entity
- relevant relationships
- current state
- active constraints

These anchors replace the need for breadcrumb trails.

## Orientation for agents

Agents do not need breadcrumbs.  
They need:

- node identity
- edge semantics
- constraints
- objectives

Contextual orientation serves both.
