# GraphNav 04 — Decision Points and Contextual Flow

In graph navigation, flow is not predefined.  
Flow **emerges from decisions**.

## What a decision point is

A decision point is a node where:

- multiple edges are available
- each edge implies intent
- consequences differ

Designing decision points is designing responsibility.

## Contextual flow over linear flow

Linear flows assume:

- a single correct path
- uniform intent
- predictable outcomes

Graph flows adapt:

- to user intent
- to state
- to permissions
- to uncertainty

Flow becomes contextual, not scripted.

## Making decisions legible

Designers should:

- group options by intent
- expose consequences
- hide invalid paths
- require confirmation where needed

A good decision point reduces regret.

## Flow for agents

Agents select edges based on:

- constraints
- objectives
- confidence
- authority

Clear decision modeling enables safe autonomy.
