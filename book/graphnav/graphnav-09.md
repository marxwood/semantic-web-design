# GraphNav 09 — Entry Points and Multiple Starts

In graph navigation, **every node can be a start**.

Users and agents arrive:

- from search
- from links
- from automation
- from history
- from external systems

Design must assume **non-canonical entry**.

## Why "home" is optional

A home page assumes:

- a beginning
- a linear onboarding
- a privileged perspective

Graphs do not have a single beginning.
They have **contexts**.

Home becomes just another node.

## Designing entry-ready nodes

Every node should answer immediately:

- What is this?
- Why does it matter?
- What state am I seeing?
- What can I do next?

If a node requires prior context to be usable, navigation is brittle.

## Entry points for agents

Agents frequently start mid-graph.

Design must ensure:

- machine-readable context
- explicit constraints
- safe defaults
- clear objectives

Implicit onboarding is not onboarding.
