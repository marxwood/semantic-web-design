# GraphNav 10 — Coherence Without a Center

Graphs do not need a center to be coherent.

Coherence emerges from **consistent meaning**, not from a privileged node.

## What creates coherence in graphs

Coherence comes from:
- stable entity identity
- well-defined relationships
- consistent state modeling
- predictable constraints
- clear consequences

If these hold, orientation emerges naturally.

## Why centralized navigation fails

Central hubs:
- over-aggregate meaning
- hide relationships
- become dumping grounds
- break when the system grows

They simulate coherence instead of producing it.

## Designing for distributed sensemaking

Designers should:
- ensure local clarity at every node
- reinforce relationships visually and semantically
- avoid global shortcuts that bypass meaning
- prefer contextual links over universal menus

Sensemaking becomes distributed.

## Closing the GraphNav cluster

At this point, navigation is:
- relational, not hierarchical
- contextual, not scripted
- discoverable, not overwhelming
- safe for humans and agents

The graph is now usable.
