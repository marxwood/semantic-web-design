# GraphNav 07 — Discoverability and Progressive Revelation

Graphs can overwhelm.  
Good graph navigation reveals structure **gradually**.

Discoverability is not showing everything.  
It is showing **the right next things**.

## Why progressive revelation is mandatory

Exposing the full graph:

- increases cognitive load
- creates choice paralysis
- obscures intent
- discourages exploration

Progressive revelation aligns discovery with purpose.

## What to reveal, when

Designers should reveal:

- immediate, relevant edges first
- risky or irreversible paths later
- advanced relationships on demand
- rarely used edges contextually

Revelation should follow intent, not completeness.

## Signals that guide discovery

Good graph systems use:

- edge grouping by intent
- visual or textual hints of consequence
- previews of destination meaning
- confidence indicators

Discovery becomes informed, not accidental.

## Progressive revelation for agents

Agents also require staging:

- constrained search spaces
- priority-ranked edges
- confidence-aware expansion
- escalation thresholds

Unlimited traversal is unsafe.
