# GraphNav 02 — Edges, Not Menus

Menus list destinations.  
Edges explain **why** you can go there.

Semantic Web Design replaces menu-driven navigation with **edge-driven navigation**.

## What an edge represents

An edge is a meaningful relationship:
- "authored by"
- "depends on"
- "related to"
- "can transition to"

Edges carry intent and context.

## Why menus are lossy

Menus:
- flatten relationships
- hide semantics
- force memorization
- scale poorly

Edges preserve meaning at the moment of choice.

## Designing edges explicitly

Designers should:
- name edges clearly
- group edges by intent
- hide irrelevant edges
- surface consequences of traversal

Edges are interaction affordances, not just links.

## Discovery over orientation

In graph navigation:
- users discover structure by moving
- context is reinforced at every step
- orientation emerges from relationships

This reduces cognitive load over time.
