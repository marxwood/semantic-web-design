# GraphNav 06 — Return Paths and Closure

Exploration without closure becomes disorientation.

Graph navigation must deliberately design **return paths** and **closure points**.

## What closure means in a graph

Closure is the moment when:

- intent is satisfied
- risk is resolved
- action completes
- context stabilizes

It is not "going back."  
It is **knowing you are done**.

## Designing return paths

Return paths should:

- preserve context
- respect state changes
- avoid forcing linear backtracking
- acknowledge completed actions

"Back" is rarely the right answer.

## Closure for agents

Agents need explicit signals:

- completion states
- success vs partial success
- unresolved issues
- escalation requirements

Implicit closure leads to loops and retries.

## A design warning

If users ask "What now?" after an action, closure is missing.
