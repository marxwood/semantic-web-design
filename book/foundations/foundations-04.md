# Foundations 04 — Design as Contract, Not Decoration

Design used to be evaluated as a layer placed on top of software.  
That model breaks the moment software becomes callable by non-humans.

In a semantic product, design is not a skin.  
Design is a **contract**.

## What a “contract” means in product terms

A contract is a set of enforceable statements about:

- what exists
- what can be done
- what must not happen
- what is guaranteed after an action
- what evidence can be inspected

A screen cannot guarantee any of this.  
A semantic system can.

## Contracts are already in your UI (just undocumented)

You already design contracts, but they are encoded indirectly:

- “Are you sure?” dialogs signal irreversibility.
- Disabled controls signal permissions.
- Error states signal invalid constraints.
- Empty states signal missing prerequisites.

In most products, these signals are visual—meaning is implicit.  
Semantic Web Design makes the contract explicit and reusable.

## The contract is the product

The product is not the UI.  
The UI is a projection of the contract.

Once you accept this, several things follow:

- UI can vary without losing coherence
- multiple UIs can exist without duplication
- automation becomes safe because constraints are explicit
- governance becomes possible because meaning is reviewable

## Capabilities are contract clauses

Capabilities are not buttons.  
Buttons are one way to render a capability.

A capability declares:

- inputs (what it needs)
- constraints (what is allowed)
- effects (what changes)
- outputs (what becomes true)

If you cannot express those, you are designing interaction theater.
