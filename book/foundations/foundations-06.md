# Foundations 06 — Designing for Multiple Operators

Every serious product today has more than one operator.

Some operators are human.  
Some are automated.  
Some are hybrid.

Design that assumes a single human operator is already obsolete.

## Who is an operator

An operator is anything that can:

- read the system
- decide to act
- execute a capability
- observe the result

This includes:

- end users
- administrators
- scripts
- workflows
- agents

Design does not get to choose this. Reality already did.

## Why this breaks traditional UX assumptions

Classic UX assumes:

- intent is local and immediate
- feedback is visual
- errors are handled interactively

Multi-operator systems violate all three.

An agent may:

- act asynchronously
- operate without UI
- require explicit contracts instead of visual hints

If meaning is implicit, operators will diverge.

## The design responsibility

Designers must ensure that:

- capabilities are equally legible to humans and machines
- constraints are not hidden in UI conventions
- irreversible actions are explicitly marked
- permission models are inspectable
- outcomes are traceable

This is not “designing for machines.”  
It is designing **honestly**.

## A simple rule

If an agent can misuse your product more easily than a human can understand it, the design is incomplete.
