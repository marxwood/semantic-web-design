# Foundations 05 — The Product Surface Is a Projection

A surface is not the product.  
A surface is a **projection** of the product’s semantic system into a context.

When teams design “the UI,” they usually design a single projection and mistake it for the system.

Semantic Web Design reverses this:

- the system is designed first
- surfaces are derived

## What a projection is

A projection is a selective view:

- it chooses which entities to reveal
- it chooses which relationships to emphasize
- it chooses which capabilities to expose
- it chooses which constraints to enforce visibly

A projection is contextual by definition.

## Why this changes how you design navigation

Navigation is not “moving between screens.”  
Navigation is **traversing meaning**.

Good graph navigation is:

- predictable (typed edges)
- constrained (no meaningless jumps)
- discoverable (related concepts are visible)
- safe (irreversible actions are gated)

This applies to humans and agents.

## Why projection-first systems collapse

If you design screens first:

- relationships become ad hoc
- flows become brittle
- reuse becomes cosmetic
- governance becomes impossible
- automation becomes a scraping problem

The system becomes a set of handcrafted exceptions.

## The simplest architecture shift

Instead of:

> “Design the screen, then implement the data behind it.”

You design:

> “Design the meaning, then render the surfaces.”

That is the entire pivot.
