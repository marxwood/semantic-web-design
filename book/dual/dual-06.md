# Dual 06 — Audit Surfaces

Auditability is not a back-office feature.  
It is a **surface of truth**.

Semantic systems must expose audit surfaces as first-class projections.

## What an audit surface is

An audit surface is a projection that:

- exposes historical actions
- links actions to actors
- references governing rules
- preserves temporal order
- cannot be altered retroactively

It is not a log dump.  
It is a navigable explanation of responsibility.

## Designing audit surfaces for humans

Human audit surfaces should:

- support investigation
- enable comparison
- highlight anomalies
- allow drill-down by entity, actor, or rule

Audits are sensemaking exercises.

## Designing audit surfaces for agents

Agents use audit surfaces to:

- validate assumptions
- detect drift
- adjust confidence
- escalate to humans

Audits enable learning without blind repetition.

## The design warning

If audit data exists but is not navigable, accountability is performative.
