# Dual 07 — Failure, Escalation, and Human Override

Failure is not an exception.  
Failure is a **designed-for condition**.

Semantic Web Design treats failure paths as first-class interaction surfaces.

## Why failure must be explicit

Implicit failure leads to:

- silent data corruption
- runaway automation
- untraceable responsibility
- loss of trust

Explicit failure enables control.

## Types of failure to design for

Designers must assume:

- invalid assumptions
- partial execution
- conflicting constraints
- degraded confidence
- unavailable dependencies

Each type demands a different response.

## Escalation as an interaction

Escalation is not "asking a human."  
It is a **transition of authority**.

Escalation must specify:

- why escalation occurred
- what is blocked
- what decision is required
- what context is preserved

Bad escalation creates panic.  
Good escalation creates clarity.

## Human override, precisely defined

Human override is:

- explicit
- logged
- scoped
- reversible where possible

Override without traceability is sabotage.
