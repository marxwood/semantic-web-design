# Dual 08 — Safe Stops and System Halting

Every powerful system needs a way to stop.

Not crash.  
Not fail silently.  
**Stop safely.**

## What a safe stop is

A safe stop is a controlled transition to a state where:

- no further irreversible actions occur
- context is preserved
- responsibility is clear
- recovery paths are defined

It is not an error state.  
It is a **protective state**.

## Designing halt conditions

Systems should halt when:

- confidence drops below threshold
- constraints conflict
- authority is ambiguous
- external dependencies fail
- unexpected side effects appear

Failing to halt is a design failure.

## Kill switches vs safe stops

Kill switches:

- are blunt
- break context
- erase nuance

Safe stops:

- preserve meaning
- enable diagnosis
- support recovery
- respect responsibility

Design safe stops. Avoid panic buttons.

## Closing the Dual cluster

At this point, dual surfaces:

- act safely
- explain themselves
- escalate responsibly
- stop when required

This is the minimum bar for agent-capable systems.
