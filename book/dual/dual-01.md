# Dual 01 — Human Surface + Machine Surface

Modern products are operated by humans **and** machines.

Design that serves only one creates asymmetry, risk, and drift.

Dual Surfaces treat human and machine interfaces as **equal projections** of the same semantic core.

## What "dual" actually means

Dual does not mean:

- two products
- duplicated logic
- parallel implementations

Dual means:

- one meaning
- multiple projections
- strict semantic parity

If humans and machines see different rules, the system will fail.

## Human surfaces

Human surfaces optimize for:

- comprehension
- narrative context
- progressive disclosure
- error recovery
- trust signaling

They translate semantics into experience.

## Machine surfaces

Machine surfaces optimize for:

- explicitness
- determinism
- completeness
- constraint visibility
- auditability

They translate semantics into contracts.

## The parity rule

Anything a human can do:

- a machine must be able to reason about

Anything a machine can do:

- a human must be able to understand

Breaking this rule creates blind spots.
