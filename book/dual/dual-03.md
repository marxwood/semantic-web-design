# Dual 03 — Intent Capture

Actions without declared intent are dangerous.

Semantic Web Design requires systems to **capture intent explicitly**, not infer it from clicks or API calls.

## What intent capture means

Intent capture is the act of declaring:

- what outcome is desired
- why this action is being taken
- under which constraints
- with what acceptable risk

This declaration becomes part of the semantic record.

## Why intent matters

Without intent:

- errors look identical to misuse
- automation cannot explain itself
- audits lack context
- recovery is guesswork

Intent turns action into accountable decision-making.

## Designing intent capture for humans

Human intent capture may include:

- structured choices ("approve", "publish", "override")
- justification fields
- previews of consequences
- explicit acknowledgment of risk

The goal is clarity, not friction.

## Designing intent capture for agents

Agents must provide:

- declared objectives
- confidence levels
- constraint awareness
- fallback conditions

If an agent cannot explain its intent, it should not act.
