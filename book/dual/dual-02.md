# Dual 02 — Designing for Operators

Interfaces are not designed for "users."  
They are designed for **operators**.

An operator is any actor—human or machine—that can cause change.

## Why "user" is insufficient

"User" collapses:

- authority
- intent
- responsibility

Operators differ in:

- permissions
- goals
- risk tolerance
- accountability

Design must reflect this.

## Operator-aware design

Operator-aware systems:

- expose authority explicitly
- gate actions by role
- surface responsibility
- adapt projections to intent

This applies equally to humans and agents.

## Intent as a first-class signal

Designers must capture:

- what the operator is trying to achieve
- under which constraints
- with what acceptable risk

Intent shapes projection.

## Avoiding operator confusion

If two operators see the same surface but have different authority, the design is misleading.

Semantic systems prevent this by construction.
