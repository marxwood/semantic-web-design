# Semantics 05 — Provenance and Trust

Trust is not a visual property.  
Trust emerges from **provenance**.

If a system cannot explain where something came from, it cannot be trusted—by humans or by agents.

## What provenance is

Provenance answers four questions:

- who created this
- when it was created
- how it was created
- under which authority or rule

Without these, meaning is ungrounded.

## Why provenance must be designed

Provenance is often treated as logging.  
That is too late.

Designers must decide:

- which actions require attribution
- which changes need justification
- which histories must be visible
- which can remain implicit

Every omission is a trust decision.

## Trust as an interaction outcome

Users do not “feel” trust because of colors or animations.  
They trust systems that:

- explain changes
- preserve history
- expose responsibility
- admit uncertainty

Semantic Web Design makes these properties explicit.

## Agents demand provenance

Agents do not infer trust socially.  
They require explicit signals.

If provenance is missing:

- agents cannot rank reliability
- automation becomes brittle
- escalation logic fails

Designing provenance is designing safe autonomy.
