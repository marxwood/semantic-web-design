# Semantics 06 — Boundaries of Meaning

Every semantic system has limits.  
The danger lies in pretending it does not.

Semantic Web Design requires designers to define **where meaning stops**.

## Why boundaries matter

Without boundaries:

- entities leak into each other
- rules are misapplied
- agents overreach
- responsibility blurs

Ambiguity is not flexibility.  
It is deferred failure.

## Types of semantic boundaries

Designers must explicitly mark:

- scope boundaries (where a concept applies)
- authority boundaries (who can assert meaning)
- temporal boundaries (when meaning expires)
- confidence boundaries (how certain something is)

These are not technical details.  
They are interaction guarantees.

## Designing for uncertainty

Uncertainty must be represented, not hidden.

Good semantic systems:

- expose confidence levels
- allow revision
- avoid false precision
- prevent irreversible actions under uncertainty

This is a design choice.

## When meaning must stop

A system must know when to say:

- “I don’t know”
- “This is out of scope”
- “Human review required”

Designing these exits is part of responsible design.
