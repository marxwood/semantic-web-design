# Semantics 04 — Time, History, and Meaning

Meaning is not static.  
It evolves over time.

Semantic Web Design treats time as a first-class dimension of meaning, not as an afterthought.

## Why history matters

Without history:

- accountability is impossible
- trust erodes
- automation cannot be audited
- errors cannot be explained

“Current state” is never enough.

## Events vs states

States describe _what is_.  
Events describe _what happened_.

A semantic system must preserve both.

Designers should distinguish:

- state views (where we are)
- history views (how we got here)

## Designing for traceability

Traceability requires:

- named transitions
- timestamps
- actors (human or agent)
- reasons

If you cannot answer “why did this change?”, the design is incomplete.

## Temporal UX patterns

Designers should deliberately design:

- timelines
- diff views
- rollback affordances
- historical comparisons

These are not admin features.  
They are trust features.
