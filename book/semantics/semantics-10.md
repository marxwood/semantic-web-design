# Semantics 10 — Power, Responsibility, and Accountability

Semantic systems distribute power.

Every capability, permission, and override assigns responsibility—whether you acknowledge it or not.

## Power must be designed deliberately

Power exists whenever:

- actions affect others
- changes are irreversible
- authority is asymmetric

Ignoring power does not remove it.  
It only makes it invisible.

## Responsibility follows capability

If an operator can act, someone must be accountable.

Designers must ensure:

- actions have owners
- escalation paths exist
- accountability is traceable
- blame is not diffused into “the system”

This is not governance theater.  
This is operational integrity.

## Accountability as an interaction feature

Accountability is not a legal document.  
It is an interaction outcome.

Users should be able to see:

- who did what
- when it happened
- why it was allowed
- how to respond

If accountability is hidden, trust collapses.

## Closing the Semantics cluster

At this point, we have defined:

- what exists (entities)
- how it changes (states, actions)
- who can act (authority)
- who is responsible (accountability)

This is the semantic backbone of the product.

Everything that follows builds on this.
