# Semantics 09 — Permissions and Authority

Not every operator is equal.  
Not every action should be possible for everyone.

Semantic Web Design distinguishes **ability** from **authority**.

## Authority is semantic, not visual

A role badge does not grant authority.  
A disabled button does not define permission.

Authority is a semantic rule that states:

- who may perform which actions
- on which entities
- under which conditions
- with which scope

If authority is encoded only in UI, it is unenforceable.

## Permissions as part of meaning

Permissions are not an access-control afterthought.  
They are part of what an entity _means_.

Changing permissions changes the meaning of the system.

Designers must participate in:

- defining authority boundaries
- naming privileged actions
- making power visible
- preventing silent escalation

## Designing for least privilege

Good semantic systems:

- grant minimal authority
- require explicit escalation
- log privileged actions
- expose power asymmetries

This protects users, operators, and organizations.

## Authority in agentic systems

Agents amplify mistakes.

If authority is implicit:

- agents overreach
- automation escalates silently
- failures become systemic

Explicit authority is non-negotiable.
