# Semantics 03 — States and Transitions

Most products behave as state machines, but are rarely designed as such.

Semantic Web Design makes states and transitions explicit so behavior becomes predictable, governable, and automatable.

## Why state is unavoidable

The moment something can change, it has state.

If you do not model state explicitly:

- transitions become implicit
- edge cases multiply
- bugs become “unexpected behavior”
- agents become dangerous

State exists whether you name it or not.

## What a state is

A state is a **meaningful condition** of an entity at a point in time.

A state:

- has a name
- implies allowed actions
- forbids other actions
- may require preconditions

“Draft”, “Published”, “Archived” are not UI labels.  
They are semantic states.

## Transitions define behavior

A transition is a permitted change between states.

Transitions:

- encode business rules
- express irreversibility
- define responsibility
- create audit trails

Buttons trigger transitions.  
They do not define them.

## The design responsibility

Designers must:

- name states precisely
- visualize transitions clearly
- expose irreversible boundaries
- prevent illegal transitions

If a transition surprises users, the semantic model is wrong.
