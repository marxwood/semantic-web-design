# Semantics 08 — Side Effects and Irreversibility

Not all actions are equal.

Some actions can be undone.  
Others permanently change meaning.

Semantic Web Design requires designers to treat **irreversibility as a first-class concept**.

## What side effects are

A side effect is any change not strictly required to achieve the primary intent.

Side effects may:

- affect other entities
- alter permissions
- trigger downstream automations
- invalidate assumptions

If side effects are invisible, systems become dangerous.

## Designing irreversibility

Irreversible actions must be:

- named clearly
- gated deliberately
- confirmed explicitly
- audited permanently

A confirmation dialog without semantic backing is theater.

## Why this matters for trust

Users forgive mistakes when:

- consequences are clear
- recovery is possible
- responsibility is visible

Agents require the same guarantees, but explicitly.

## The design obligation

Designers must ensure:

- irreversible boundaries are visible
- no irreversible action is accidental
- uncertainty blocks irreversibility
- escalation paths exist

This is safety design.
