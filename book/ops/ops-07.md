# Ops 07 — Access Control Models

Access control is not about security alone.  
It is about **power distribution** inside a semantic system.

Poorly designed access control distorts meaning.

## Why access control is semantic

Permissions define:
- who may assert truth
- who may change state
- who may override constraints
- who is accountable

Changing permissions changes the meaning of the system.

## Common access control models

Semantic systems often combine:
- role-based access (RBAC)
- attribute-based access (ABAC)
- context-based constraints
- temporal limits

Designers must understand the tradeoffs, not just engineers.

## Designing visible authority

Good access control design:
- makes authority visible at action points
- explains why something is allowed or blocked
- avoids "mystery denials"
- logs privilege use explicitly

Invisible power erodes trust.

## Access control for agents

Agents require:
- explicit authority scopes
- expiration rules
- escalation-only privileges
- auditability

Long-lived, unbounded agent authority is a critical risk.
