# Ops 08 — Change Management

Change is inevitable.  
Unmanaged change is destructive.

Semantic Web Design treats change as a **first-class operational process**.

## What changes in semantic systems

Change may affect:

- entity definitions
- relationships
- constraints
- policies
- capabilities
- authority boundaries

Each change has ripple effects.

## Designing change pathways

Effective change management requires:

- explicit proposals
- impact analysis
- staged rollout
- coexistence of versions
- clear deprecation signals

Change must be navigable, not surprising.

## Communicating change

Designers must ensure:

- affected operators are notified
- intent of change is visible
- old behavior is explained
- migration paths are clear

Silence is not communication.

## Closing the Ops cluster

At this point, the system is:

- governable
- observable
- adaptable
- accountable
- resilient

Operations completes the semantic lifecycle.
