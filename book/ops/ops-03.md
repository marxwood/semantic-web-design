# Ops 03 — Guardrails

Guardrails are not restrictions.  
They are **conditions for safe motion**.

Semantic systems without guardrails accelerate toward failure.

## What a guardrail is

A guardrail is a non-negotiable rule that:
- blocks unsafe actions
- forces escalation
- requires additional certainty
- preserves system integrity

Guardrails sit *before* damage, not after.

## Designing guardrails deliberately

Effective guardrails:
- are explicit and named
- trigger early
- explain why they activate
- offer safe alternatives

Silent guardrails feel like bugs.  
Transparent guardrails feel like competence.

## Guardrails vs policies

Policies decide *what should happen*.  
Guardrails decide *what must not happen*.

Both are required.

## Guardrails for agents

Agents must:
- detect guardrail conditions
- halt or escalate deterministically
- log activation context
- avoid repeated retries

Retrying past a guardrail is a design defect.
