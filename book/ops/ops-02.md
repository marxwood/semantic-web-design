# Ops 02 — Contextual Policies

Rules that ignore context become brittle.  
Rules that adapt without transparency become dangerous.

Contextual policies balance both.

## What a contextual policy is

A contextual policy is a rule whose application depends on:
- actor (who)
- entity (what)
- state (when)
- confidence (how sure)
- environment (where)

Policies are semantic, not infrastructural.

## Why policies must be explicit

Implicit policies:
- surprise operators
- confuse agents
- break audits
- enable abuse

Explicit policies:
- can be reviewed
- can be reasoned about
- can be simulated
- can be enforced consistently

## Designing policy surfaces

Designers should ensure:
- policies are visible at decision points
- consequences of violation are clear
- overrides are explicit
- uncertainty blocks enforcement when needed

Policy design is interaction design.

## For agents

Agents require:
- machine-readable policies
- deterministic evaluation
- clear failure modes
- escalation rules

Policy opacity leads to unsafe autonomy.
