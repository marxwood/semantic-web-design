# Ops 06 — Learning Loops

A system that does not learn will fail repeatedly.

Learning loops turn experience into **explicit knowledge**.

## What a learning loop is

A learning loop captures:

- what happened
- why it happened
- what assumption failed
- what rule must change
- how confidence is adjusted

This knowledge must re-enter the system.

## Closing the loop

Learning loops must:

- update semantic models
- refine constraints
- adjust policies
- improve projections
- recalibrate agents

If learning stays external, it decays.

## Designers in learning loops

Designers are responsible for:

- updating meaning
- clarifying boundaries
- improving affordances
- preventing repeat confusion

Learning is a design activity.

## Agents and learning

Agents can:

- propose hypothesis updates
- detect pattern recurrence
- suggest constraint refinements
- flag risky trends

But humans must approve semantic change.
