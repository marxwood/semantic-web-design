# Ops 05 — Incident Response as Sensemaking

Incidents are not failures of people.  
They are **failures of understanding**.

Semantic Web Design reframes incident response as a sensemaking process.

## Why blame blocks learning

Blame-focused response:
- narrows investigation
- hides systemic causes
- discourages reporting
- repeats incidents

Systems improve when understanding improves.

## What an incident really is

An incident occurs when:
- system behavior diverges from expectation
- constraints interact unexpectedly
- assumptions are violated
- meaning breaks under pressure

Treat incidents as signals, not scandals.

## Designing incident response flows

Effective incident response requires:
- immediate stabilization
- preservation of context
- clear timelines
- traceable decisions
- visible uncertainty

Response is an interaction flow, not a checklist.

## Human–agent collaboration in incidents

Agents should:
- detect anomalies early
- halt unsafe actions
- surface evidence
- assist diagnosis

Humans should:
- interpret context
- revise assumptions
- decide on change
