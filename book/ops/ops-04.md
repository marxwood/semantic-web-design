# Ops 04 — Observability

If you cannot see the system, you cannot govern it.

Observability is the ability to understand **what the system is doing and why**, in real time and after the fact.

## What observability is (and is not)

Observability is not:

- raw logs
- dashboards without meaning
- metrics without context

Observability is **semantic visibility**.

## What must be observable

At minimum:

- actions taken
- states changed
- constraints evaluated
- policies applied
- guardrails triggered
- actors involved (human or agent)

Without these, incidents are mysteries.

## Designing observable surfaces

Designers should ensure:

- events are named consistently
- timelines are navigable
- causes link to rules
- effects link to entities

Observability is an interaction surface, not a backend concern.

## Observability for agents

Agents rely on observability to:

- adjust strategies
- detect drift
- calibrate confidence
- decide when to escalate

Blind agents are dangerous agents.
