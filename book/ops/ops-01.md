# Ops 01 — Governance: Who Owns Meaning

Every semantic system answers a question, whether explicitly or not:  
**Who is allowed to define what things mean?**

Governance is the discipline of making that answer explicit.

## Why meaning requires ownership

When meaning has no owner:

- definitions drift
- rules conflict
- responsibility diffuses
- trust collapses

Semantic systems amplify ambiguity unless governance exists.

## What "owning meaning" entails

Ownership does not mean unilateral control.  
It means responsibility for:

- defining entities and relationships
- approving semantic changes
- resolving conflicts
- maintaining consistency over time

Governance is stewardship, not authority theater.

## Distributed ownership models

Large systems often require:

- domain owners
- shared vocabularies
- cross-domain review
- escalation paths

Designers must participate in governance design, not just execution.

## Governance as a visible system

Governance must be:

- discoverable
- inspectable
- enforceable
- explainable

If users cannot tell who owns meaning, governance does not exist.
